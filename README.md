# DBM1-INSA2022

This is the repository used to organize and build our DBM1: Databases and Data Mining project as part of Riccardo Tommassini's class at INSA Lyon.

We retrieved the dataset of our project from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cbxkgl/uefa-champions-league-2016-2022-data

It contains information related to the UEFA Champions League seasons from 2016 to 2022.

We have made certain design choices and visualized them in an ER diagram, as it can be seen in the ER_Diagram.png file.

To create the relevant tables in the database, execute the uefa_champions_league.sql file.

The data must be imported manually from the .csv files included in this repository.

That's it! Enjoy!
